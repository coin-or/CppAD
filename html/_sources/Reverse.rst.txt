Reverse Mode
############

Multiple Directions
*******************
Reverse mode after :ref:`Forward(q, r, xq)<forward_dir-name>`
with number of directions *r*  != 1 is not yet supported.
There is one exception, :ref:`reverse_one-name` is allowed
because there is only one zero order forward direction.
After such an operation, only the zero order forward
results are retained (the higher order forward results are lost).
