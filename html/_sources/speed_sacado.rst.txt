Speed Test Derivatives Using Sacado
###################################

Purpose
*******
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
Sacado with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the Sacado speed tests
(any suggestions to make the Sacado results faster are welcome).

sacado_prefix
*************
To run these tests,
you must include the :ref:`sacado_prefix-name`
in you :ref:`cmake@CMake Command` .

Running Tests
*************
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
:ref:`cmake@Build Directory` :

| |tab| ``cd speed/sacado``
| |tab| ``make check_speed_sacado VERBOSE`` =1

You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command

   ./ ``speed_sacado speed`` *seed*

where *seed* is a positive integer.
See :ref:`speed_main-name` for more options.
