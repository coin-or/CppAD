Speed Test of Functions in Double
#################################

Purpose
*******
CppAD has a set of speed tests for just calculating functions
(in double precision instead of an AD type).
This section links to the source code the function value speed tests.

Running Tests
*************
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
:ref:`cmake@Build Directory` :

| |tab| ``cd speed/double``
| |tab| ``make check_speed_double VERBOSE`` =1

You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command

   ./ ``speed_double speed`` *seed*

where *seed* is a positive integer.
See :ref:`speed_main-name` for more options.
