Atomic Function Constructor
###########################

Syntax
******

| ``class`` *atomic_user* : ``public CppAD::atomic_four<`` *Base* > {
| ``public:``
| |tab| *atomic_user* ( *ctor_arg_list* ) : ``CppAD::atomic_four<`` *Base* >( *name* )
| |tab| ...
| };
| *atomic_user afun* ( *ctor_arg_list* )

Prototype
*********
{xrst_literal
   // BEGIN_PROTOTYPE
   // END_PROTOTYPE
}

atomic_user
***********

ctor_arg_list
=============
Is a list of arguments for the *atomic_user* constructor.

afun
====
The object *afun* must stay in scope for as long
as the corresponding atomic function is used.
This includes use by any :ref:`ADFun\<Base><ADFun-name>` object that
has this *atomic_user* operation in its
:ref:`operation sequence<glossary@Operation@Sequence>` .

Implementation
==============
The user defined *atomic_user* class is a publicly derived class of
``atomic_four<`` *Base* > .
It should be declared as follows:

| |tab| ``class`` *atomic_user* : ``public CppAD::atomic_four<`` *Base* > {
| |tab| ``public:``
| |tab| |tab| *atomic_user* ( *ctor_arg_list* ) : ``atomic_four<`` *Base* >( *name* )
| |tab| ...
| |tab| };

where ...
denotes the rest of the implementation of the derived class.
This includes completing the constructor and
all the virtual functions that have their
``atomic_four`` implementations replaced by
*atomic_user* implementations.

atomic_four
***********

Restrictions
============
The ``atomic_four`` constructor and destructor cannot be called in
:ref:`parallel<ta_in_parallel-name>` mode.

Base
====
The template parameter determines the
:ref:`atomic_four_call@Base`
type for this ``AD<`` *Base* > atomic operation.

name
====
This ``atomic_four`` constructor argument has the following prototype

   ``const std::string&`` *name*

It is the name for this atomic function and is used for error reporting.
The suggested value for *name* is *afun* or *atomic_user* ,
i.e., the name of the corresponding atomic object or class.

Example
*******
The following is an example constructor definition taken from
:ref:`atomic_four_norm_sq.cpp-name` :
{xrst_literal
   example/atomic_four/norm_sq.cpp
   // BEGIN CONSTRUCTOR
   // END CONSTRUCTOR
}

{xrst_end atomic_four_ctor}
