Specifications for A Team of AD Threads
#######################################

Syntax
******

| ``include`` ``"team_thread.hpp"``
| *ok* = ``team_create`` ( *num_threads* )
| *ok* = ``team_work`` ( *worker* )
| *ok* = ``team_destroy`` ()
| *name* = ``team_name`` ()

Purpose
*******
These routines start, use, and stop a team of threads that can
be used with the CppAD type ``AD<double>`` .
For example,
these could be OpenMP threads, pthreads, or Boost threads to name a few.

Restrictions
************
Calls to the routines
``team_create`` ,
``team_work`` , and
``team_destroy`` , must all be done by the master thread; i.e.,
:ref:`thread_num<ta_thread_num-name>` must be zero.
In addition, they must all be done in sequential execution mode; i.e.,
when the master thread is the only thread that is running
(:ref:`in_parallel<ta_in_parallel-name>` must be false).

team_create
***********
The argument
*num_threads*  > 0 has type ``size_t``
and specifies the number of threads in this team.
This initializes both ``AD<double>`` and ``team_work``
to be used with *num_threads* .
If *num_threads*  > 1 ,
*num_threads* ``- 1`` new threads are created
and put in a waiting state until ``team_work`` is called.

team_work
*********
This routine may be called one or more times
between the call to ``team_create`` and ``team_destroy`` .
The argument *worker* has type
``bool`` *worker* ( ``void`` ) .
Each call to ``team_work`` runs *num_threads* versions
of *worker* with the corresponding value of
:ref:`thread_num<ta_thread_num-name>`
between zero and *num_threads* ``- 1`` and
different for each thread,

team_destroy
************
This routine terminates all the other threads except for
thread number zero; i.e., it terminates the threads corresponding to

   *thread_num* = 1 , ... , *num_threads* ``-1``

team_name
*********
This routines returns a name that identifies this thread_team.
The return value has prototype

   ``const char`` * *name*

and is a statically allocated ``'\0'`` terminated C string.

ok
**
The return value *ok* has type ``bool`` .
It is ``false`` if an error is detected during the
corresponding call.
Otherwise it is ``true`` .
