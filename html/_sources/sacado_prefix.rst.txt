If Sacado is installed on your system, you can
specify a value for its install *sacado_prefix* on the
:ref:`cmake-name` command line.
The value of *sacado_prefix* must be such that,
for one of the directories *dir* in
:ref:`cmake@cmake_install_includedirs` ,

   *sacado_prefix* / *dir* / ``Sacado.hpp``

is a valid way to reference to the include file ``Sacado.hpp`` ;

Speed Tests
***********
If you include *sacado_prefix* on the :ref:`cmake-name` command line,
you will be able to run the Sacado speed correctness tests
by executing the following commands starting in the
:ref:`download@Distribution Directory` :

| |tab| ``cd build/speed/sacado``
| |tab| ``make check_speed_sacado``

After executing ``make check_speed_sacado`` ,
you can run a specific Sacado speed test
by executing the command ``./speed_sacado`` ;
see :ref:`speed_main-name` for the meaning of the command line
options to this program.

**********
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of Sacado using :ref:`get_sacado.sh-name` .
