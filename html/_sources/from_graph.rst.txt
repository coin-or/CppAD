ADFun Object Corresponding to a CppAD Graph
###########################################

Syntax
******

| |tab| ``cpp_graph`` *graph_obj*
| |tab| ``ADFun<`` *Base* > *fun*
| |tab| *fun* . ``from_graph`` ( *graph_obj* )
| |tab| *fun* . ``from_graph`` ( *graph_obj* , *dyn2var* , *var2dyn* )

Prototype
*********
{xrst_literal
   // BEGIN_ONE_ARGUMENT
   // END_ONE_ARGUMENT
}
{xrst_literal
   // BEGIN_WITH_IS_DYNAMIC
   // END_WITH_IS_DYNAMIC
}

Base
****
is the type corresponding to this :ref:`adfun-name` object;
i.e., its calculations are done using the type *Base* .

RecBase
*******
in the prototype above, *RecBase* is the same type as *Base* .

graph_obj
*********
is a :ref:`cpp_ad_graph-name` representation of this function.

dyn2var
*******
is a vector with size equal to the number of independent dynamic parameters
in the graph; i.e., the size of :ref:`cpp_ad_graph@Node Indices@p` .
It specifies which independent dynamic parameters in the graph are
independent variables in the function *fun* .

var2dyn
*******
is a vector with size equal to the number of independent variables
in the graph; i.e., the size of :ref:`cpp_ad_graph@Node Indices@x` .
It specifies which independent variables in the graph are
independent dynamic parameters in the function *fun* .

fun
***
It *dyn2var* and *var2dyn* are not present,
the independent dynamic parameters and independent variables in *fun*
are the same as for the graph.
Otherwise, they are described below.

m_true, m_false
===============
Let *m_true* ( *m_false* ) be the number of true (false)
elements of *dyn2var* .

n_true, n_false
===============
Let *n_true* ( *n_false* ) be the number of true (false)
elements of *var2dyn* .

Independent Dynamic Parameters
==============================
The first *m_false* independent dynamic parameters in *fun*
correspond to the false components of *dyn2var*
and have the same order as in the graph.
The next *n_true* independent dynamic parameters in *fun*
correspond to the true components of *var2dyn*
and have the same order as in the graph.

Independent Variables
=====================
The first *m_true* independent variables in *fun*
correspond to the true components of *dyn2var*
and have the same order as in the graph.
The next *n_false* independent variables in *fun*
correspond to the false components of *var2dyn*
and have the same order as in the graph.

Examples
********
The file :ref:`switch_var_dyn.cpp-name` contains an example and test
of this routine.
For simpler examples, that do not change the dynamic parameters and variables;
see :ref:`graph_op_enum examples<graph_op_enum@Examples>` .
