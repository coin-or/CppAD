Convert From AD to Integer
##########################

Syntax
******
*i* = ``Integer`` ( *x* )

Purpose
*******
Converts from an AD type to the corresponding integer value.

i
*
The result *i* has prototype

   ``int`` *i*

x
*

Real Types
==========
If the argument *x* has either of the following prototypes:

| |tab| ``const float`` & *x*
| |tab| ``const double`` & *x*

the fractional part is dropped to form the integer value.
For example, if *x* is 1.5, *i* is 1.
In general, if :math:`x \geq 0`, *i* is the
greatest integer less than or equal *x* .
If :math:`x \leq 0`, *i* is the
smallest integer greater than or equal *x* .

Complex Types
=============
If the argument *x* has either of the following prototypes:

| |tab| ``const std::complex<float>`` & *x*
| |tab| ``const std::complex<double>`` & *x*

The result *i* is given by

   *i* = ``Integer`` ( *x* . ``real`` ())

AD Types
========
If the argument *x* has either of the following prototypes:

| |tab| ``const AD<`` *Base* >               & *x*
| |tab| ``const VecAD<`` *Base* >:: ``reference &`` *x*

*Base* must support the ``Integer`` function and
the conversion has the same meaning as for *Base* .

Operation Sequence
******************
The result of this operation is not an
:ref:`glossary@AD of Base` object.
Thus it will not be recorded as part of an
AD of *Base*
:ref:`operation sequence<glossary@Operation@Sequence>` .

Example
*******
{xrst_toc_hidden
   example/general/integer.cpp
}
The file
:ref:`integer.cpp-name`
contains an example and test of this operation.

{xrst_end Integer}
