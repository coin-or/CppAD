Speed Test of Derivatives Using Adolc
#####################################

Purpose
*******
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
Adolc with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the Adolc speed tests
(any suggestions to make the Adolc results faster are welcome).

include_adolc
*************
To run these tests
you must specify :ref:`cmake@include_adolc`
on your cmake command line.

Running Tests
*************
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
:ref:`cmake@Build Directory` :

| |tab| ``cd speed/adolc``
| |tab| ``make check_speed_adolc VERBOSE`` =1

You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command

   ./ ``speed_adolc speed`` *seed*

where *seed* is a positive integer.
See :ref:`speed_main-name` for more options.
