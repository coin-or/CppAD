Evaluate a Polynomial or its Derivative
#######################################

Syntax
******

   # ``include <cppad/utility/poly.hpp>``

*p* = ``Poly`` ( *k* , *a* , *z* )

Description
***********
Computes the *k*-th derivative of the polynomial

.. math::

   P(z) = a_0 + a_1 z^1 + \cdots + a_d z^d

If *k* is equal to zero, the return value is :math:`P(z)`.

Include
*******
The file ``cppad/utility/poly.hpp``
is included by ``cppad/cppad.hpp``
but it can also be included separately with out the rest of
the ``CppAD`` routines.
Including this file defines
``Poly`` within the ``CppAD`` namespace.

k
*
The argument *k* has prototype

   ``size_t`` *k*

It specifies the order of the derivative to calculate.

a
*
The argument *a* has prototype

   ``const`` *Vector* & *a*

(see :ref:`Poly@Vector` below).
It specifies the vector corresponding to the polynomial :math:`P(z)`.

z
*
The argument *z* has prototype

   ``const`` *Type* & *z*

(see *Type* below).
It specifies the point at which to evaluate the polynomial

p
*
The result *p*  has prototype

   *Type* *p*

(see :ref:`Poly@Type` below)
and it is equal to the *k*-th derivative of :math:`P(z)`; i.e.,

.. math::

   p = \frac{k !}{0 !} a_k
     + \frac{(k+1) !}{1 !} a_{k+1} z^1
     + \ldots
     + \frac{d !}{(d - k) !} a_d z^{d - k}

If :math:`k > d`, *p* = *Type* (0) .

Type
****
The type *Type* is determined by the argument *z* .
It is assumed that
multiplication and addition of *Type* objects
are commutative.

Operations
==========
The following operations must be supported where
*x* and *y* are objects of type *Type*
and *i* is an ``int`` :

.. list-table::

   * - *x* = *i*
     - assignment
   * - *x* = *y*
     - assignment
   * - *x* \\* = *y*
     - multiplication compound assignment
   * - *x* += *y*
     - addition compound assignment

Vector
******
The type *Vector* must be a :ref:`SimpleVector-name` class with
:ref:`elements of type<SimpleVector@Elements of Specified Type>`
*Type* .
The routine :ref:`CheckSimpleVector-name` will generate an error message
if this is not the case.

Operation Sequence
******************
The *Type* operation sequence used to calculate *p* is
:ref:`glossary@Operation@Independent`
of *z* and the elements of *a*
(it does depend on the size of the vector *a* ).
