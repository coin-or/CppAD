# CppAD pkg-config Files
# ######################
#
# Purpose
# *******
# The ``pkg-config`` program helps with the used if installed libraries
# and include files; see its
# `guide <https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html>`_
# for more information on writing an using pkg-config files.
#
# cppad.pc
# ********
#
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH
# ===============
# The ``cppad.pc`` file is installed in the following two directories:
#
# | |tab| *prefix* / *libdir* / ``pkgconfig``
# | |tab| *prefix* / *datadir* / ``pkgconfig``
#
# where *prefix* is :ref:`cmake@cppad_prefix` ,
# *libdir* is the first entry in
# :ref:`cmake@cmake_install_libdirs` ,
# and # *datadir* is
# :ref:`cmake@cmake_install_datadir` .
# In order to use ``pkg-config`` ,
# one of these directories must your ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` .
#
# Compile Flags
# =============
# The necessary flags for compiling code that includes CppAD can
# be obtained with the command
# ::
#
#     pkg-config --cflags cppad
#
# Link Flags
# ==========
# The flags for linking can be obtains with the command
# ::
#
#     pkg-config --libs cppad
#
# Extra Definitions
# =================
# The ``cppad.pc`` file contains the text:
#
# | |tab| ``prefix`` = *prefix*
# | |tab| ``exec_prefix`` = *exec_prefix*
# | |tab| ``includedir`` = *includedir*
# | |tab| ``libdir`` = *libdir*
#
# where *prefix* , *exec_prefix* , *includedir* , and
# *libdir* are the
# `gnu installation variables <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html>`_.
#
# cppad-uninstalled.pc
# ********************
#
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH
# ===============
# The ``cppad-uninstalled.pc`` file is located in the following directory:
#
#     *builddir* / ``pkgconfig``
#
# where *builddir* is the directory where the :ref:`cmake-name` command
# is executed.
#
# Compile Flags
# =============
# The necessary flags for compiling code that includes CppAD,
# before CppAD is installed, can be obtained with the command
# ::
#
#     pkg-config --cflags cppad-uninstalled
#
# Link Flags
# ==========
# The flags for linking can be obtains with the command
# ::
#
#     pkg-config --libs cppad-uninstalled
#
# Extra Definitions
# =================
# The ``cppad-uninstalled.pc`` file has the same extra variables
# as the ``cppad.pc`` file.
