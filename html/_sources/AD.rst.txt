AD Objects
##########

Purpose
*******
The sections listed below describe the operations
that are available to :ref:`glossary@AD of Base` objects.
These objects are used to :ref:`glossary@Tape`
an AD of *Base*
:ref:`operation sequence<glossary@Operation@Sequence>` .
This operation sequence can
be transferred to an :ref:`ADFun-name` object where it
can be used to evaluate the corresponding
function and derivative values.

Base Type Requirements
**********************
The *Base* requirements are provided by the CppAD package
for the following base types:
``float`` ,
``double`` ,
``std::complex<float>`` ,
``std::complex<double>`` .
Otherwise, see :ref:`base_require-name` .
