Syntax
******

| # ``include <cppad/utility/test_boolofvoid.hpp>``
| ``test_boolofvoid`` *Run* ( *group* , *width* )
| *Run* ( *test* , *name* )

*ok* = *Run* . ``summary`` ( *memory_ok* )

Purpose

The object *Run* is used to run a group of tests functions
and report the results on standard output.

group
*****

   ``const std::string&`` *group*

It is the name for this group of tests.

It must be greater than the maximum number of characters in a test name.

test
****

This is true if all of the tests pass (including the memory leak test),
otherwise it is false.
