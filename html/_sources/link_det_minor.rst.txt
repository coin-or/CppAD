Speed Testing Gradient of Determinant by Minor Expansion
########################################################

Prototype
*********
{xrst_literal
   // BEGIN PROTOTYPE
   // END PROTOTYPE
}

Method
******
The same template class :ref:`det_by_minor-name`
is used by the different AD packages.

job
***
See the standard link specifications for :ref:`link_routines@job` .

size
****
See the standard link specifications for :ref:`link_routines@size`
In addition, *size* is the number of rows and columns in
*matrix* .

repeat
******
See the standard link specifications for :ref:`link_routines@repeat` .

matrix
******
The argument *matrix* is a vector with
*size* * *size* elements.
The input value of its elements does not matter.
The output value of its elements is the last matrix that the
gradient (or determinant) is computed for.

gradient
********
The argument *gradient* is a vector with
*size* * *size* elements.
The input value of its elements does not matter.
The output value of its elements is the gradient of the
determinant of *matrix* with respect to its elements.

double
======
In the case where *package* is ``double`` ,
only the first element of *gradient* is used and it is actually
the determinant value (the gradient value is not computed).
