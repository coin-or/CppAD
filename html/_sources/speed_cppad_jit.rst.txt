Speed Test Derivatives Using cppad_jit
######################################

Purpose
*******
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
cppad_jit with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the cppad_jit speed tests
(any suggestions to make the cppad_jit results faster are welcome).

Running Tests
*************
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
:ref:`cmake@Build Directory` :

| |tab| ``cd speed/cppad_jit``
| |tab| ``make check_speed_cppad_jit VERBOSE`` =1

You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command

   ./ ``speed_cppad_jit speed`` *seed*

where *seed* is a positive integer.
See :ref:`speed_main-name` for more options.
