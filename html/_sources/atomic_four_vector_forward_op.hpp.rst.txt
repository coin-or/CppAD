Atomic Vector Forward Mode: Example Implementation
##################################################

Purpose
*******
The ``forward`` routine overrides the virtual functions
used by the atomic_four base class for forward mode calculations; see
:ref:`forward<atomic_four_forward-name>` .
It determines which operator is specified for this call and transfers
the call to the operator's implementation.
There are two versions of the ``forward`` routine, one for *Base*
and one for ``AD<Base>`` .
