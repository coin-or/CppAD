Get At Least A Specified Amount of Memory
#########################################

Deprecated 2011-08-31
*********************
Use the function :ref:`thread_alloc::get_memory<ta_get_memory-name>` instead.

Syntax
******

   # ``include <cppad/utility/omp_alloc.hpp>``

*v_ptr* = ``omp_alloc::get_memory`` ( *min_bytes* , *cap_bytes* )

Purpose
*******
Use :ref:`omp_alloc-name` to obtain a minimum number of bytes of memory
(for use by the :ref:`current thread<omp_get_thread_num-name>` ).

min_bytes
*********
This argument has prototype

   ``size_t`` *min_bytes*

It specifies the minimum number of bytes to allocate.

cap_bytes
*********
This argument has prototype

   ``size_t&`` *cap_bytes*

It's input value does not matter.
Upon return, it is the actual number of bytes (capacity)
that have been allocated for use,

   *min_bytes* <= *cap_bytes*

v_ptr
*****
The return value *v_ptr* has prototype

   ``void`` * *v_ptr*

It is the location where the *cap_bytes* of memory
that have been allocated for use begins.

Allocation Speed
****************
This allocation should be faster if the following conditions hold:

#. The memory allocated by a previous call to ``get_memory``
   is currently available for use.
#. The current *min_bytes* is between
   the previous *min_bytes* and previous *cap_bytes* .

{xrst_end omp_get_memory}
