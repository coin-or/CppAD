Introduction
************
This section organizes the information related to the CppAD examples.
Each CppAD operation has its own specific example,
for example :ref:`add.cpp-name` is an example for
:ref:`addition<ad_binary-name>` .
Some of the examples are of a more general nature
(not connected of a specific feature of CppAD).
In addition, there are some utility functions that are used
by the examples.

get_started
***********
The :ref:`get_started.cpp-name` example is a good place to start using CppAD.

Running Examples
****************
The
:ref:`installation instructions<Install-name>`
show how the examples can be run on your system.

The CppAD Test Vector Template Class
************************************
Many of the examples use the ``CPPAD_TESTVECTOR`` preprocessor symbol
( see :ref:`testvector-name` )
to determine which :ref:`SimpleVector-name` template class is used with
the examples.
