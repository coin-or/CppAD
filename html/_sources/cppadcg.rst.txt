Including CppADCodeGen Examples and Tests
#########################################

CppADCodeGen Home Page
**********************
https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen.git

Purpose
*******
CppAD includes examples and test that use the CppADCodeGen package,
abbreviated as ``cppadcg`` , see:
:ref:`code_gen_fun-name` .

include_cppadcg
***************
If ``include_cppadcg=true`` is on the cmake command line,
then the pkg-config will find the
necessary information to include cppadcg.
The value of *PKG_CONFIG_PATH* must be such that the command

   ``pkg-config cppadcg --path --print-errors``

finds the location of the file ``cppadcg.pc`` .

Speed Tests
***********
If ``include_cppadcg=true`` is on the cmake command line,
you will be able to run the cppadcg speed correctness tests
by executing the following commands starting in the
:ref:`download@Distribution Directory` :

| |tab| ``cd build/speed/cppadcg``
| |tab| ``make check_speed_cppadcg``

After executing ``make check_speed_cppadcg`` ,
you can run a specific cppadcg speed test
by executing the command ``./speed_cppadcg`` ;
see :ref:`speed_main-name` for the meaning of the command line
options to this program.

get_cppadcg
***********
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of cppadcg using :ref:`get_cppadcg.sh-name` .
The corresponding install prefix is
``build/prefix`` .
