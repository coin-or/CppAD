*********************
Use the function :ref:`thread_alloc::available<ta_available-name>` instead.

   # ``include <cppad/utility/omp_alloc.hpp>``

*num_bytes* = ``omp_alloc::available`` ( *thread* )

Purpose

Memory being managed by :ref:`omp_alloc-name` has two states,
currently in use by the specified thread,
and quickly available for future use by the specified thread.
This function informs the program how much memory is available.

This argument has prototype

   ``size_t`` *thread*

Either :ref:`omp_get_thread_num-name` must be the same as *thread* ,
or the current execution mode must be sequential
(not :ref:`parallel<omp_in_parallel-name>` ).

num_bytes
