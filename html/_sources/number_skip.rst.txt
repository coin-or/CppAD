Number of Variables that Can be Skipped
#######################################

Syntax
******
*n* = *f* . ``number_skip`` ()

See Also
========
:ref:`fun_property-name`

Purpose
*******
The :ref:`conditional expressions<CondExp-name>` use either the
:ref:`if_true<CondExp-name>` or :ref:`if_false<CondExp-name>` .
Hence, some terms only need to be evaluated
depending on the value of the comparison in the conditional expression.
The :ref:`optimize-name` option is capable of detecting some of these
case and determining variables that can be skipped.
This routine returns the number such variables.

n
*
The return value *n* has type ``size_t``
is the number of variables that the optimizer has determined can be skipped
(given the independent variable values specified by the previous call to
:ref:`f.Forward<Forward-name>` for order zero).

f
*
The object *f* has prototype

   ``ADFun<`` *Base* > *f*
