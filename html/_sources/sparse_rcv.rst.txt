SizeVector
**********
We use :ref:`sparse_rc@SizeVector` to denote the
:ref:`SimpleVector-name` class corresponding to *pattern* .

ValueVector
***********
We use *ValueVector* to denote the
:ref:`SimpleVector-name` class corresponding to *val* .

empty
*****
This is an empty sparse matrix object. To be specific,
the corresponding number of rows *nr* ,
number of columns *nc* ,
and number of possibly non-zero values *nnz* ,
are all zero.

pattern
*******
This constructor argument has prototype

   ``const sparse_rc<`` *SizeVector* >& *pattern*

It specifies the number of rows, number of columns and
the possibly non-zero entries in the *matrix* .

matrix
******
This is a sparse matrix object with the sparsity specified by *pattern* .
Only the *val* vector can be changed. All other values returned by
*matrix* are fixed during the constructor and constant there after.
The *val* vector is only changed by the constructor
and the ``set`` function.
There are two exceptions to this rule, where *other* appears in the
assignment and swap syntax.

other
*****

Assignment and Constructor
==========================
In the assignment and constructor, *other* has prototype

   ``const sparse_rcv<`` *SizeVector* , *ValueVector* >& *other*

After this assignment and constructor, *other* is an independent copy
of *matrix* ; i.e. it has all the same values as *matrix*
and changes to *matrix* do not affect *other* .

Move Semantics Assignment and Constructor
=========================================
In the assignment and constructor, if *other* has prototype

   ``sparse_rcv<`` *SizeVector* , *ValueVector* >&& *other*

A move semantics version of the assignment operator is used; e.g.,
when *other* is a function return value;

swap
====
After the swap operation *other* ( *matrix* ) is equivalent
to *matrix* ( *other* ) before the operation.

nr
**
This return value has prototype

   ``size_t`` *nr*

and is the number of rows in *matrix* .

nc
**
This argument and return value has prototype

   ``size_t`` *nc*

and is the number of columns in *matrix* .

nnz
***
We use the notation *nnz* to denote the number of
possibly non-zero entries in *matrix* .

set
***
This function sets the value

   *val* [ *k* ] = *v*

k
=
This argument has type

   ``size_t`` *k*

and must be less than *nnz* .

v
=
This argument has type

   ``const`` *ValueVector* :: ``value_type&`` *v*

It specifies the value assigned to *val* [ *k* ] .

row
***
This vector has size *nnz* and
*row* [ *k* ]
is the row index of the *k*-th possibly non-zero
element in *matrix* .

col
***
This vector has size *nnz* and
*col* [ ``k`` ] is the column index of the *k*-th possibly non-zero
element in *matrix*

val
***
This vector has size *nnz* and
*val* [ ``k`` ] is value of the *k*-th possibly non-zero entry
in the sparse matrix (the value may be zero).

pat
***
This is equal to the sparsity pattern; i.e.,
*pattern* in the constructor.

row_major
*********
This vector has prototype

   *SizeVector* *row_major*

and its size *nnz* .
It sorts the sparsity pattern in row-major order.
To be specific,

   *col* [ *row_major* [ *k* ] ] <= *col* [ *row_major* [ *k* +1] ]

and if *col* [ *row_major* [ *k* ] ] == *col* [ *row_major* [ *k* +1] ] ,

   *row* [ *row_major* [ *k* ] ] < *row* [ *row_major* [ *k* +1] ]

This routine generates an assert if there are two entries with the same
row and column values (if ``NDEBUG`` is not defined).

col_major
*********
This vector has prototype

   *SizeVector* *col_major*

and its size *nnz* .
It sorts the sparsity pattern in column-major order.
To be specific,

   *row* [ *col_major* [ *k* ] ] <= *row* [ *col_major* [ *k* +1] ]

and if *row* [ *col_major* [ *k* ] ] == *row* [ *col_major* [ *k* +1] ] ,

   *col* [ *col_major* [ *k* ] ] < *col* [ *col_major* [ *k* +1] ]

This routine generates an assert if there are two entries with the same
row and column values (if ``NDEBUG`` is not defined).

Eigen Matrix
************
If you have the :ref:`eigen package<eigen-name>` in your include path,
you can use :ref:`sparse2eigen-name` to convert a sparse matrix to eigen format.
