{xrst_begin Value}

Convert From an AD Type to its Base Type
########################################

Syntax
******
*b* = ``Value`` ( *x* )

See Also
********
:ref:`var2par-name`

Purpose
*******
Converts from an AD type to the corresponding
:ref:`glossary@Base Type` .

x
*
The argument *x* has prototype

   ``const AD<`` *Base* > & *x*

b
*
The return value *b* has prototype

   *Base* *b*

Operation Sequence
******************
The result of this operation is not an
:ref:`glossary@AD of Base` object.
Thus it will not be recorded as part of an
AD of *Base*
:ref:`operation sequence<glossary@Operation@Sequence>` .

Restriction
***********
The argument *x* must not be a
:ref:`glossary@Variable` or
:ref:`glossary@Parameter@Dynamic` parameter
because its dependency information
would not be included in the ``Value`` result *b* .

Example
*******
{xrst_toc_hidden
   example/general/value.cpp
}
The file
:ref:`value.cpp-name`
contains an example and test of this operation.

{xrst_end Value}
