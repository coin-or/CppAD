# Download and Install The CppAD Optional Packages
# ################################################
#
# Syntax
# ******
# ``bin/get_optional.sh``
#
# Purpose
# *******
# If you are using Unix, this command will download and install
# all of the optional packages that can be used with CppAD.
#
# Distribution Directory
# **********************
# This command must be executed in the
# :ref:`download@Distribution Directory` .
#
# prefix
# ******
# This is the prefix for installing the optional packages.
# It can be changed by editing its setting of *prefix* below
# in the file ``bin/get_optional.sh`` .
# Note that there can only be one setting that is not commented out with
# a  at the start of its line.
#
# Absolute Path
# =============
# If the first character in the prefix is a ``/`` ,
# it is an absolute path; e.g., the following setting:
# {xrst_spell_off}
# {xrst_code sh}
# prefix="$HOME/prefix/cppad"
# {xrst_code}
# {xrst_spell_on}
#
# Relative Path
# =============
# If the first character in the prefix is **not** a ``/`` ,
# it is a path relative to the distribution directory;
# e.g., the following setting:
# {xrst_spell_off}
# {xrst_code sh}
prefix="build/prefix"
# {xrst_code}
# {xrst_spell_on}
#
# Configuration
# =============
# If you do an install and then change the *prefix* ,
# you should delete all the files listed by the following command:
#
#     ``ls external/`` * . ``configured``
#
# get_optional.log
# ****************
# This file contains the standard out output for each of the optional scripts
# in the order that they are executed.
#
# get_optional.err
# ****************
# This file contains the standard error output for each of the optional scripts
# in the order that they are executed.
