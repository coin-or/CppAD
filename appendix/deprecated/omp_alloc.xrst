A Quick OpenMP Memory Allocator Used by CppAD
#############################################

Syntax
******
| ``# include <cppad/omp_alloc.hpp>``

Purpose
*******
The C++ ``new`` and ``delete`` operators are thread safe,
but this means that a thread may have to wait for a lock on these operations.
Once memory is obtained for a thread, the ``omp_alloc`` memory
allocator keeps that memory :ref:`omp_available-name` for the thread so that
it can be re-used without waiting for a lock.
All the CppAD memory allocations use this utility.
The :ref:`omp_free_available-name` function should be used to return memory
to the system (once it is no longer required by a thread).

Include
*******
The routines in sections below are defined by ``cppad/omp_alloc.hpp`` .
This file is included by
``cppad/cppad.hpp`` , but it can also be included separately with out
the rest of the ``CppAD`` .

Deprecated 2011-08-23
*********************
Use :ref:`thread_alloc-name` instead.
