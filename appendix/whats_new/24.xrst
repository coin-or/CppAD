Changes and Additions to CppAD During 2024
##########################################

mm-dd
*****

01-08
=====
On some systems ``unsigned int`` and ``size_t`` are the same type
and this would cause a compile error in ``vector.hpp`` and
``vector_bool.hpp`` . This has been fixed.

01-07
=====
The forward_two :ref:`forward_two@Syntax` was corrected.
To be specific, 
``Forward`` (1, *x2* ) was changed to ``Forward`` (2, *x2* ) .
In addition, some other minor improvements were made to the
forward_two documentation page.

01-03
=====

#. The change on :ref:`whats_new_23@mm-dd@12-24` 2023,
   when :ref:`cmake@cppad_debug_and_release` was implemented,
   was not done properly and might cause a mistaken assertion.
   This has been fixed.

#. Each *file_name* in the latest documentation was moved
   (this is important if you have links to previous web pages):

   .. list-table::

      *  - Old Location
         - ``https://cppad.readthedocs.io/``\ *file_name*
      *  - New Location
         - ``https://cppad.readthedocs.io/latest/``\ *file_name*

01-02
=====

#. The :ref:`compare_change.cpp-name` example/test would sometimes fail
   when :ref:`cmake@cppad_debug_which` was ``debug_even`` or
   ``debug_odd`` (because it was compiled for debugging and including
   a release version of a utility). This has been fixed by making this
   example/test a separate program.

#. The :ref:`CppAD_vector@vectorBool` constructor would generate a
   warning when called with an ``int`` for the size of the vector
   (on some compilers). This has been fixed.
