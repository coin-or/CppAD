two arguments and one result.

Notation
********

name
****
The last two characters in the *name* for a binary operator are
``p`` (for parameter) or ``v`` (for variable).
For example the name ``subvp`` corresponding to subtraction
with a variable on the left (first) and a parameter on the right (second).

=
We use *x* to denote the first argument of this binary operation.
This argument is a variable or a parameter depending on the operator.

=
We use *y* to denote the second argument of this binary operation.
This argument is a variable or a parameter depending on the operator.

z
=
We use *z* to denote the result of this binary operation.
The result is always a variable.

using ``AD`` < *Base* > and computations by this routine are done using
type *Base* .
