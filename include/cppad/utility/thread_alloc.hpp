Setup thread_alloc For Use in Multi-Threading Environment
#########################################################

Syntax
******
| ``thread_alloc::parallel_setup`` ( *num_threads* , *in_parallel* , *thread_num* )

Purpose
*******
By default there is only one thread and all execution is in sequential mode,
i.e., multiple threads are not sharing the same memory; i.e.
not in parallel mode.

Speed
*****
It should be faster, even when *num_thread* is equal to one,
for ``thread_alloc`` to hold onto memory.
This can be accomplished using the function call

   ``thread_alloc::hold_memory`` ( ``true`` )

see :ref:`hold_memory<ta_hold_memory-name>` .

num_threads
***********
This argument has prototype

   ``size_t`` *num_threads*

and must be greater than zero.
It specifies the number of threads that are sharing memory.
The case *num_threads*  == 1 is a special case that is
used to terminate a multi-threading environment.

in_parallel
***********
This function has prototype

   ``bool`` *in_parallel* ( ``void`` )

It must return ``true`` if there is more than one thread
currently executing.
Otherwise it can return false.

In the special case where *num_threads*  == 1 ,
the routine *in_parallel* is not used.

thread_num
**********
This function has prototype

   ``size_t`` *thread_num* ( ``void`` )

It must return a thread number that uniquely identifies the
currently executing thread.
Furthermore

   0 <= *thread_num* () < *num_threads*

.
In the special case where *num_threads*  == 1 ,
the routine *thread_num* is not used.

Note that this function is called by other routines so,
as soon as a new thread is executing,
one must be certain that *thread_num* () will
work for that thread.

Restrictions
************
The function ``parallel_setup`` must be called before
the program enters :ref:`parallel<ta_in_parallel-name>` execution mode.
In addition, this function cannot be called while in parallel mode.

Example
*******
The files
:ref:`openmp_get_started.cpp-name` ,
:ref:`bthread_get_started.cpp-name` , and
:ref:`pthread_get_started.cpp-name` ,
contain examples and tests that use this function.

Get At Least A Specified Amount of Memory
#########################################

Syntax
******
*v_ptr* = ``thread_alloc::get_memory`` ( *min_bytes* , *cap_bytes* )

Purpose
*******
Use :ref:`thread_alloc-name` to obtain a minimum number of bytes of memory
(for use by the :ref:`current thread<ta_thread_num-name>` ).

min_bytes
*********
This argument has prototype

   ``size_t`` *min_bytes*

It specifies the minimum number of bytes to allocate.
This value must be less than
::

   std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max() / 2

cap_bytes
*********
This argument has prototype

   ``size_t&`` *cap_bytes*

It's input value does not matter.
Upon return, it is the actual number of bytes (capacity)
that have been allocated for use,

   *min_bytes* <= *cap_bytes*

v_ptr
*****
The return value *v_ptr* has prototype

   ``void`` * *v_ptr*

It is the location where the *cap_bytes* of memory
that have been allocated for use begins.

Allocation Speed
****************
This allocation should be faster if the following conditions hold:

#. The memory allocated by a previous call to ``get_memory``
   is currently available for use.
#. The current *min_bytes* is between
   the previous *min_bytes* and previous *cap_bytes* .

Alignment
*********
We call a memory allocation aligned if the address is a multiple
of the number of bytes in a ``size_t`` value.
If the system ``new`` allocator is aligned, then *v_ptr*

Syntax
******

Purpose
*******
Create a new raw array using :ref:`thread_alloc-name` memory allocator

and call default constructor for each element.

Type
****
The type of the elements of the array.

This is the minimum number of elements that there can be
in the resulting *array* .

size_out
********
This argument has prototype

The input value of this argument does not matter.
Upon return, it is the actual number of elements
in *array*
( *size_min* <= *size_out* ).

array
*****
The return value *array* has prototype

   *Type* * *array*

It is array with *size_out* elements.
The default constructor for *Type* is used to initialize the
elements of *array* .
Note that :ref:`delete_array<ta_delete_array-name>`
should be used to destroy the array when it is no longer needed.

Delta
*****
The amount of memory :ref:`inuse<ta_inuse-name>` by the current thread,
will increase *delta* where

   ``sizeof`` ( *Type* ) * ( *size_out* + 1) > *delta* >= ``sizeof`` ( *Type* ) * *size_out*

(and the allocation will be faster)
if a previous allocation with *size_min* between its current value
and *size_out* is available.

Alignment

We call a memory allocation aligned if the address is a multiple
of the number of bytes in a ``size_t`` value.

Free All Memory That Was Allocated for Use by thread_alloc
##########################################################

Syntax
******
*ok* = ``thread_alloc::free_all`` () .

Purpose
*******
Returns all memory that was used by ``thread_alloc`` to the system.

ok
**
The return value *ok* has prototype

   ``bool`` *ok*

Its value will be ``true`` if all the memory can be freed.
This requires that for all *thread* indices, there is no memory
:ref:`inuse<ta_inuse-name>` ; i.e.,

   0 == ``thread_alloc::inuse`` ( *thread* )

Otherwise, the return value will be false.

Restrictions
************
This function cannot be called while in parallel mode.

Example
*******
:ref:`thread_alloc.cpp-name`

{xrst_end ta_free_all}
*/
   /*!
   Return to the system all thread_alloc memory that is not currently inuse.

   \return
   If no thread_alloc memory is currently inuse,
   all memory is returned to the system and the return value is true.
   Otherwise the return value is false.
