$section Speed Test Derivatives Using cppad_jit$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
cppad_jit with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the cppad_jit speed tests
(any suggestions to make the cppad_jit results faster are welcome).




$head Running Tests$$
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd speed/cppad_jit
    make check_speed_cppad_jit VERBOSE=1
%$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command
$codei%
    ./speed_cppad_jit speed %seed%
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
