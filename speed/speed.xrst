Speed Test an Operator Overloading AD Package
#############################################

Purpose
*******
Cppad has a set of speed tests that are used to determine if
changes improve its execution speed.
These tests can also be used to compare the AD packages
:ref:`Adolc<adolc@Adolc Home Page>` ,
Cppad,
:ref:`Fadbad<fadbad_prefix@Fadbad Home Page>` ,
:ref:`Cppadcg<cppadcg@CppADCodeGen Home Page>` ,
:ref:`Sacado<sacado_prefix@Sacado Home Page>` .

debug_which
***********
Usually, one wants to compile the speed tests in release mode.
This can be done by setting
:ref:`cmake@cppad_debug_which` to ``debug_none``
in the cmake command.
Correctness tests are included for all the speed tests,
so it is possible you will want to compile these tests for debugging; i.e.,
set *cppad_debug_which* to ``debug_all`` .

The sections below explain how you can run these tests on your computer.
