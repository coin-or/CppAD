$section Preprocessor Definitions Used by CppAD$$
$index configure, symbol$$
$index symbol, configure$$
$index PACKAGE, symbol$$
$index VERSION, symbol$$

$head Preprocessor Symbols$$
$index preprocessor, symbol$$
$index symbol, processor$$
All of the preprocessor symbols used by CppAD begin either with
$code CppAD$$ or with $code CPPAD_$$.

$head Example$$
For example,
the preprocessor symbol 
$small $cref/CPPAD_TEST_VECTOR/test_vector/$$ $$ 
determines which
$xref/SimpleVector/$$ template class is extensively used 
by the tests in the $code Example$$ and $code TestMore$$ directories.

$head config.h$$
$index config.h$$
The following is a list of exceptions to the rule above.
These preprocessor symbols are placed in the file $code cppad/config.h$$
by $code autoconf$$ (which is used to generate the CppAD distribution).
Directly after you include a CppAD file, these symbols may be undefined:
$code PACKAGE$$,
$code PACKAGE_BUGREPORT$$,
$code PACKAGE_NAME$$,
$code PACKAGE_STRING$$,
$code PACKAGE_TARNAME$$,
$code PACKAGE_VERSION$$,
$code VERSION$$.
