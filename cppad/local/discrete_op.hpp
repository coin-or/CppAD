\file discrete_op.hpp
Zero order forward mode for z = f(x) where f is piecewise constant.
*/


/*!
Compute zero order forward mode Taylor coefficient for result of op = DisOp.

The C++ source code corresponding to this operation is
\verbatim
	z = f(x)
\endverbatim
where f is a piecewise constant function (and it's derivative is always
calculated as zero).

\tparam Base
base type for the operator; i.e., this operation was recorded
using AD< \a Base > and computations by this routine are done using type 
\a Base .

\param i_z
variable index corresponding to the result for this operation; 
i.e. the row index in \a taylor corresponding to z. 

\param arg
\a arg[0]
\n
variable index corresponding to the argument for this operator;
i.e. the row index in \a taylor corresponding to x.
\n
\n
\a arg[1]
is the index, in the order of the discrete functions defined by the user, 
for this discrete function.

\param nc_taylor
number of colums in the matrix containing all the Taylor coefficients.

\param taylor
\b Input: \a taylor [ \a arg[0] * \a nc_taylor + 0 ] 
is the zero order Taylor coefficient corresponding to x. 
\n
\b Output: \a taylor [ \a i_z * \a nc_taylor + 0 ] 
is the zero order Taylor coefficient corresponding to z. 

\par Checked Assertions where op is the unary operator with one result:
\li NumArg(op) == 2
\li NumRes(op) == 1
\li \a arg[0] < \a i_z 
\li \a 0 < \a nc_taylor
