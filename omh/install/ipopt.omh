$section Including Ipopt Library Examples, Tests, and pkg-config$$

$head Examples and Tests$$
If $cref/include_ipopt/cmake/include_ipopt/$$
is on the cmake command line,
you will be able to run the Ipopt examples and tests.

$head include_ipopt$$
If $code include_ipopt=true$$ is on the cmake command line,
then the pkg-config will find the
necessary information to link in ipopt.
The value of $icode PKG_CONFIG_PATH$$ must be such that the command
$codei%
    pkg-config ipopt --path --print-errors
%$$
finds the location of the file $code ipopt.pc$$.

$head Deprecated Library$$
If $code include_ipopt=true$$ is on the cmake command line,
the deprecated $cref cppad_ipopt_nlp$$
example and tests as well as installing the $code cppad_ipopt$$ library
during the $code make install$$ step.

$head get_ipopt$$
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of Ipopt using $cref get_ipopt.sh$$.
The corresponding install prefix is
$code build/prefix$$.

$head Include Directories$$
It may be necessary to remove $code /coin-or$$ from the end of the
include directories reported by
$codei%
    pkg-config ipopt --cflags
