$section Including Adolc Examples and Tests$$

$head Adolc Home Page$$
$href%https://projects.coin-or.org/ADOL-C%$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD includes examples and tests that can use the AD package Adolc.
The includes speed comparison with other AD packages; see
$cref speed_adolc$$.
It also includes examples that combine Adolc with
CppAD; see
$table
$rref base_adolc.hpp$$
$rref mul_level_adolc.cpp$$
$rref mul_level_adolc_ode.cpp$$
$tend


$head include_adolc$$
If Adolc is installed on your system, you can
specify $code include_adolc=true$$ on the
$cref cmake$$ command line.
The value of $code PKG_CONFIG_PATH$$ must be such that the command
$codei%
    pkg-config adolc --path --print-errors
%$$
finds the location of the file $code adolc.pc$$.
Note that CppAD assumes adolc has been configured with
its sparse matrix computations enabled; i.e, using
$codei%
    --with-colpack=%adolc_prefix%
%$$
In other words ColPack is installed and
with the same prefix as ACOL-C; see
$cref get_colpack.sh$$.

$head Examples$$
If you specify $cref/include_adolc/cmake/include_adolc/$$ on the cmake command
line, you will be able to run the Adolc examples listed above
by executing the following commands starting in the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd build/example
    make check_example
%$$
If you do this,
you will see an indication that the examples
$code mul_level_adolc$$ and $code mul_level_adolc_ode$$
have passed their correctness check.

$head Speed Tests$$
If you include $icode adolc_prefix$$ on the $cref cmake$$ command line,
you will be able to run the Adolc speed correctness tests
by executing the following commands starting in the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd build/speed/adolc
    make check_speed_adolc
%$$
After executing $code make check_speed_adolc$$,
you can run a specific Adolc speed tests
by executing the command $code ./speed_adolc$$;
see $cref speed_main$$ for the meaning of the command line
options to this program.

$head Unix$$
If you are using Unix,
you may have to add
$icode adolc_prefix$$ to $code LD_LIBRARY_PATH$$.
For example, if you use the $code bash$$ shell to run your programs,
you could include
$codei%
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%adolc_prefix%/lib:@{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
%$$
in your $code @HOME/.bashrc$$ file.

$head Cygwin$$
If you are using Cygwin,
you may have to add to following lines to the file
$code .bashrc$$ in your home directory:
$codei%
    PATH=%adolc_prefix%/bin:@{PATH}
    export PATH
%$$
in order for Adolc to run properly.
If $icode adolc_prefix$$ begins with a disk specification,
you must use the Cygwin format for the disk specification.
For example,
if $code d:/adolc_base$$ is the proper directory,
$code /cygdrive/d/adolc_base$$ should be used for $icode adolc_prefix$$.

$head get_adolc$$
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of Adolc using $cref get_adolc.sh$$.
The corresponding install prefix is
$code build/prefix$$.
