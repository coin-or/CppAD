$section Including CppADCodeGen Examples and Tests$$

$head CppADCodeGen Home Page$$
$href%https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen.git%$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD includes examples and test that use the CppADCodeGen package,
abbreviated as $code cppadcg$$, see:
$cref code_gen_fun$$.

$head include_cppadcg$$
If $code include_cppadcg=true$$ is on the cmake command line,
then the pkg-config will find the
necessary information to include cppadcg.
The value of $icode PKG_CONFIG_PATH$$ must be such that the command
$codei%
    pkg-config cppadcg --path --print-errors
%$$
finds the location of the file $code cppadcg.pc$$.

$head Speed Tests$$
If $code include_cppadcg=true$$ is on the cmake command line,
you will be able to run the cppadcg speed correctness tests
by executing the following commands starting in the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd build/speed/cppadcg
    make check_speed_cppadcg
%$$
After executing $code make check_speed_cppadcg$$,
you can run a specific cppadcg speed test
by executing the command $code ./speed_cppadcg$$;
see $cref speed_main$$ for the meaning of the command line
options to this program.

$head get_cppadcg$$
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of cppadcg using $cref get_cppadcg.sh$$.
The corresponding install prefix is
$code build/prefix$$.
