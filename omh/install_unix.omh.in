$section Unix Download, Test and Installation$$

$head Fedora$$
$index install, Fedora$$
$index Fedora, install$$
CppAD is available through yum on the Fedora operating system starting
Fedora version 7. You can download and install CppAD with the instruction
$code
	yum install cppad-devel
$$
(In Fedora, $code devel$$ is used for program development tools.)
You can download and install the corresponding version of the
documentation using the command
$code
	yum install cppad-doc
$$ 

$head RPM$$
$index rpm, cppad.spec$$
$index cppad.spec$$
If you want to use the Fedora $code cppad.spec$$ file
to build an RPM for some other operating system,
it can be found at
$pre
$$
$href%https://projects.coin-or.org/CppAD/browser/trunk/cppad.spec%$$

$subhead Subversion$$
If you are familiar with subversion, you may want to follow
the more complicated CppAD download instructions;
see the following $cref/subversion instructions/subversion/$$.

$subhead Web Link$$
If you are not using the subversion download instructions,
make sure you are reading the web version of this documentation by
following the link 
$href%http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/Doc/installunix.htm%web version%$$.
Then proceed with the instruction that appear below this point.

$subhead Unix Tar Files$$
$index CppAD, tar file$$
$index tar, CppAD file$$
The download files below were first archived with $code tar$$
and then compressed with $code gzip$$:
The ascii files for these downloads are in 
Unix format; i.e., each line ends with just a line feed.

$subhead Tar File Extraction$$
Use the unix command
$codei%
	tar -xvzf cppad-@VERSION@.%license%.tgz
%$$
(where $icode license$$ is $code cpl$$ or $code gpl$$)
to decompress and extract the unix format version
into the distribution directory
$codei%
	cppad-@VERSION@
%$$
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
	cppad-@VERSION@/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$

$head Configure$$
$index configure$$
Enter the $icode distribution_directory$$
(the directory created by the extraction) and execute the command:
$codei%
	./configure                            \
	--prefix=%PrefixDir%                     \

%$$
where only the $code configure$$ command need appear.
The entries one each of the other lines are optional
and the text in italic is replaced values that you choose.

$head make test$$
You can run all of the CppAD correctness tests by executing the 
command $code make test$$ in the $icode distribution_directory$$.
A description of the tests, and instructions for running individual tests,
are described below.

$head Introduction$$

$subhead Getting Started$$
$index get_started, run$$
$index run, get_started$$
You can run the CppAD getting started example / test 
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/introduction/get_started
%$$

$subhead exp_apx$$
$index exp_apx, run$$
$index run, exp_apx$$
$index introduction, AD$$
$index AD, introduction$$
You can run the examples / tests for the $code exp_apx$$ function 
(used in the $cref/Introduction/$$)
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/introduction/exp_apx
%$$

$head CppAD Examples$$
$index example, CppAD$$
$index CppAD, example$$
You can run a large number of the examples / tests showing how to use CppAD
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/example
%$$
See $cref/ListAllExamples/$$ for a list of all the CppAD examples.

$head More Testing$$
$index test, more$$
$index more, testing$$
You can run a large number of tests (that are not intended to be examples)
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/test_more
%$$

$head Speed Testing$$

$subhead CppAD Derivative Speed Tests$$
$index speed, CppAD check test$$
$index check, CppAD speed test$$
A set of CppAD derivative value $cref/speed/speed_cppad/$$ tests 
are included with this distribution. 
You can test that the results computed during these tests are correct
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/speed/cppad
%$$
After executing $code make test$$, you can run the CppAD derivative speed tests 
by executing the command $code ./cppad$$ (see $cref/speed_main/$$).

$subhead Function Speed Tests$$
$index speed, function check test$$
$index check, function speed test$$
A set of functions value $cref/speed/speed_double/$$ tests 
are included (to compare with derivative values speeds).
You can test that the results computed during these tests are correct
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/speed/double
%$$
After executing $code make test$$, you can run the function value speed tests 
by executing the command $code ./double$$ (see $cref/speed_main/$$).

$subhead Examples For Speed Tests$$
$index speed, utility example$$
$index example, speed utility$$
$index utility, speed example$$
The speed tests use some utilities that have their own set of 
examples / tests.
You can test that the results computed by this utilities are correct
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/speed/example
%$$

$head Profiling CppAD$$
$index speed, profile cppad$$
$index profile, cppad speed$$
$index cppad, profile speed$$
The CppAD derivative speed tests mentioned above can be profiled.
You can test that the results computed during this profiling are correct
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/speed/profile
%$$
After executing $code make test$$, you can run the profile tests 
by executing the command $code ./profile$$ (see $cref/speed_main/$$).
You can then obtain the profiling results with
$codei%
	gprof -b speed/profile/profile
%$$ 
If you are using a windows operating system with Cygwin or MinGW, 
you may have to replace $code profile$$ by $code profile.exe$$
in the $code gprof$$ command above; i.e.,
$codep
	gprof -b speed/profile/profile.exe
$$
In C++, template parameters and argument types become part of a 
routines's name.
This can make the $code gprof$$ output hard to read 
(the routine names can be very long).
You can remove the template parameters and argument types from the 
routine names by executing the following command
$codep
	gprof -b speed/profile/profile | sed -f speed/profile/gprof.sed
$$
If you are using a windows operating system with Cygwin or MinGW, 
you would need to use
$codep
	gprof -b speed/profile/profile.exe | sed -f speed/profile/gprof.sed
$$

$head PrintFor$$
$index print, forward mode$$
$index forward, print$$
You can test the $cref/PrintFor/$$ command
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/print_for
%$$

$head PrefixDir$$
$index configure, prefix directory$$
$index prefix, configure directory$$
$index directory, configure prefix$$
The default value for prefix directory is $code ^HOME$$
i.e., by default the CppAD include files 
will $cref/install/InstallUnix/make install/$$ below $code ^HOME$$.
If you want to install elsewhere, you will have to use this option.
As an example of using the $codei%--prefix=%PrefixDir%$$ option,
if you specify
$codep
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$$ 
the CppAD include files will be installed in the directory
$codei%
	/usr/local/include/cppad
%$$
If $cref/--with-Documentation/InstallUnix/--with-Documentation/$$
is specified, the CppAD documentation files will be installed in the directory
$codei%
	/usr/local/share/doc/cppad-@VERSION@
%$$

$head --with-Documentation$$
$index documentation, install$$
$index install, documentation$$
If the command line argument $code --with-Documentation$$ is specified,
the CppAD documentation HTML and XML files are copied to the directory
$codei%
	%PrefixDir%/share/doc/%PostfixDir%/cppad-@VERSION@
%$$
(see $cref/PostfixDir/InstallUnix/PostfixDir/$$).
The top of the CppAD HTML documentation tree 
(with mathematics displayed as LaTex command) will be located at
$codei%
	%PrefixDir%/share/doc/%PostfixDir%/cppad-@VERSION@/cppad.htm
%$$
and the top of the XML documentation tree
(with mathematics displayed as MathML) will be located at
$codei%
	%PrefixDir%/share/doc/%PostfixDir%/cppad-@VERSION@/cppad.xml
%$$

$head --with-stdvector$$
$index std::vector, unix$$
The 
$small $cref/CPPAD_TEST_VECTOR/test_vector/$$ $$
template class is used for extensive examples and testing of CppAD.
If the command line argument $code --with-stdvector$$ is specified,
the default definition this template class is replaced by
$codep
	std::vector
$$
(In this case $icode BoostDir$$ must not also be specified.)

$head PostfixDir$$
$index configure, postfix directory$$
$index postfix, configure directory$$
$index directory, configure postfix$$
By default, the postfix directory is empty; i.e., there
is no postfix directory.
As an example of using the $codei%POSTFIX_DIR=%PostfixDir%$$ option,
if you specify
$codep
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local POSTFIX_DIR=coin
$$ 
the CppAD include files will be 
$cref/installed/InstallUnix/make install/$$ in the directory
$codei%
	/usr/local/include/coin/cppad
%$$
If $cref/--with-Documentation/InstallUnix/--with-Documentation/$$
is specified, the CppAD documentation files will be installed in the directory
$codei%
	/usr/local/share/doc/coin/cppad-@VERSION@
%$$

$head AdolcDir$$
$index Adolc, unix$$
If you have 
$href%
	http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~adol-c/%
	Adolc 1.10.2
%$$
installed on your system, you can 
specify a value for $icode AdolcDir$$ in the 
$xref/InstallUnix/Configure/configure/$$ command line.
The value of $icode AdolcDir$$ must be such that
$codei%
	%AdolcDir%/include/adolc/adouble.h
%$$
is a valid way to reference $code adouble.h$$.
In this case, you can run the Adolc speed correctness tests by 
executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/speed/adolc
%$$
After executing $code make test$$, you can run the Adolc speed tests 
by executing the command $code ./adolc$$ (see $cref/speed_main/$$).

$subhead Linux$$
If you are using Linux, 
you will have to add to following lines to the file
$code .bash_profile$$ in your home directory:
$codei%
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%AdolcDir%/lib:^{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
%$$
in order for Adolc to run properly.

$subhead Cygwin$$
If you are using Cygwin, 
you will have to add to following lines to the file
$code .bash_profile$$ in your home directory:
$codei%
	PATH=%AdolcDir%/bin:^{PATH}
	export PATH
%$$
in order for Adolc to run properly.
If $icode AdolcDir$$ begins with a disk specification,
you must use the Cygwin format for the disk specification.
For example, 
if $code d:/adolc_base$$ is the proper directory,
$code /cygdrive/d/adolc_base$$ should be used for $icode AdolcDir$$.

$head FadbadDir$$
$index Fadbad, unix$$
If you have
$href%
	http://www.fadbad.com/%
	Fadbad 2.1
%$$
installed on your system, you can 
specify a value for $icode FadbadDir$$.
It must be such that
$codei%
	%FadbadDir%/FADBAD++/badiff.h
%$$
is a valid reference to $code badiff.h$$.

In this case, you can run the Fadbad speed correctness tests by 
executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/speed/fadbad
%$$
After executing $code make test$$, you can run the Fadbad speed tests 
by executing the command $code ./fadbad$$ (see $cref/speed_main/$$).


$head SacadoDir$$
$index Sacado, unix$$
If you have
$href%
	http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/sacado/%
	Sacado
%$$
installed on your system, you can 
specify a value for $icode SacadoDir$$.
It must be such that
$codei%
	%SacadoDir%/include/Sacado.hpp
%$$
is a valid reference to $code Sacado.hpp$$.

In this case, you can run the Sacado speed correctness tests by 
executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/speed/sacado
%$$
After executing $code make test$$, you can run the Sacado speed tests 
by executing the command $code ./sacado$$ (see $cref/speed_main/$$).


$head BoostDir$$
$index boost, unix$$
The
$small $cref/CPPAD_TEST_VECTOR/test_vector/$$ $$
template class is used for extensive examples and testing of CppAD.
The default definition for $code CPPAD_TEST_VECTOR$$ is
$xref/CppAD_vector//CppAD::vector/$$.
If the command line argument
$codei%
	BOOST_DIR=%BoostDir%
%$$
is present, it must be such that
$codei%
	%BoostDir%/boost/numeric/ublas/vector.hpp
%$$
is a valid reference to the file $code vector.hpp$$.
In this case, the default definition of $code CPPAD_TEST_VECTOR$$ 
is replaced by
$codep
	boost::numeric::ublas::vector
$$
(see $href%http://www.boost.org%boost%$$).
If $icode BoostDir$$ is present, the argument $code --with-stdvector$$
must not be present.

$head IpoptDir$$
$index Ipopt, unix$$
If you have
$href%
	http://www.coin-or.org/projects/Ipopt.xml%
	Ipopt
%$$
installed on your system, you can 
specify a value for $icode IpoptDir$$.
It must be such that
$codei%
	%IpoptDir%/include/coin/IpIpoptApplication.hpp
%$$
is a valid reference to $code IpIpoptApplication.hpp$$.
In this case, the CppAD interface to Ipopt
$cref/examples/cppad_ipopt_nlp/Example/$$ can be built and tested
by executing the command $code make test$$ in the directory
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/cppad_ipopt/example
%$$
You can do more testing of this interface by executing $code make test$$
in the directories
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/cppad_ipopt/test
	%distribution_directory%/cppad_ipopt/speed
%$$
Once this has been done, you can execute the program
$codei%
	%distribution_directory%/cppad_ipopt/speed/speed
%$$
see $cref/ipopt_ode_speed.cpp/$$.

$head CompilerFlags$$
$index compile, unix flags$$
$index flags, unix compile$$
If the command line argument $icode CompilerFlags$$ is present,
it specifies compiler flags.
For example,
$codei%
	CXX_FLAGS="-Wall -ansi"
%$$
would specify that warning flags $code -Wall$$
and $code -ansi$$ should be included
in all the C++ compile commands.
The error and warning flags chosen must be valid options
for the C++ compiler.
The default value for $icode CompilerFlags$$ is the
empty string.

$head TapeAddrType$$
$index memory, usage$$
$index memory, tape$$
$index tape, memory$$
If the command line argument $icode TapeAddrType$$ is present,
it specifies the type used for address in the AD recordings (tapes).
The valid values for this argument are
$code unsigned short int$$,
$code unsigned int$$,
$code size_t$$.
The smaller the value of $icode%sizeof(%TapeAddrType%)%$$,
the less memory is used.
On the other hand, the value
$codei%
	std::numeric_limits<%TapeAddrType%>::max()
%$$
must be larger than any of the following:
$cref/size_op/seq_property/size_op/$$,
$cref/size_op_arg/seq_property/size_op_arg/$$,
$cref/size_par/seq_property/size_text/$$,
$cref/size_par/seq_property/size_par/$$,
$cref/size_par/seq_property/size_VecAD/$$.


$head make install$$
Once you are satisfied that the tests are giving correct results,
you can install CppAD into easy to use directories by executing the command
$codep
	make install
$$
This will install CppAD in the location specified by 
$cref/PrefixDir/InstallUnix/PrefixDir/$$.
You must have permission to write in the $icode PrefixDir$$
directory to execute this command. 
You may optionally specify a destination directory for the install; i.e.,
$codei%
	make install DESTDIR=%DestinationDirectory%
%$$

$end
