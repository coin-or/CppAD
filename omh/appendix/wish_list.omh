$section The CppAD Wish List$$

$head Abs-normal$$
$list number$$
Change the $cref abs_normal_fun$$ to return the functions
$cref/z(x, u)/abs_normal_fun/g/z(x, u)/$$ and
$cref/y(x, u)/abs_normal_fun/g/y(x, u)/$$ instead of
$latex g(x, u)$$ and $latex a(x)$$.
We can add a utility that computes $latex a(x)$$ using
$latex z(x, u)$$, $latex a_i (x) = | z_i (x, a(x) ) |$$
and $latex z_i$$ does not depends on $latex u_j$$ for $latex j \geq i$$.
$lnext
Avoid cancellation when computing the difference in the absolute value
function at the current point $latex \hat{x}$$ the displaced point
$latex x = \hat{x} + \Delta x$$; i.e.,
$latex \[
	|z_i (x, \tilde{a}(x) ) | - |z_i (\hat{x}, a(\hat{x}) ) |
\] $$
$lend

$head Windows Install$$
The windows install procedures below have not been kept up to date.
I would be good if someone took on the job of supporting an windows install.
$list number$$
Download and install the open source program
$href%http://www.7-zip.org%$$.
$lnext
Download and install the Visual Studio Express; for example
$href%http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=44914
	%Visual Studio 2013
%$$
$lnext
In a command window, execute the following commands:
$codei|
	set PATH=|path_to_7_zip|;%PATH%
	set PATH=|path_to_cmake|;%PATH%
	set VCDIR=|path_to_vcdir|;%PATH%
	call "%VCDIR%\vcvarsall.bat" x86
|$$
$lnext
Use the following commands to extract the distribution from the
compressed archive:
$codei%
	7z x cppad-%version%.%lic%.tgz
	7z x cppad-%version%.%lic%.tar
%$$
The commands below are optional.
They run the CppAD tests using the default $cref cmake$$ settings
(except for the $cref/generator/cmake/generator/$$ option)
$codei%
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
	nmake check
%$$
$lend


$head Dynamic Parameters$$
It would be useful to have a means of changing the value of
some of the $cref/parameters/glossary/Parameter/$$ in an
$cref ADFun$$ object.
$list number$$
Perhaps
$codei%
	Independent(%x%, %abort_op_index%, %dynamic_par_vec%)
%$$
could be used to specify the independent dynamic parameters during taping.
Note that $icode abort_op_index$$ equal to zero does not abort on any
operation index.
$lnext
All operations that use dynamic parameters need to be taped.
If the other operand is a parameter (variable),
the result is a dynamic parameter (variable).
$lnext
We could add an extra field to $code%AD<%Base%>%$$,
(e.g., $code dynamic_id_$$ )
that identifies the index of a dynamic parameter in the parameter vector.
If this index is zero, or the tape_id is does not correspond to this thread,
it is not a dynamic parameter.
$lnext
After creating an $cref ADFun$$ object,
the value corresponding to the independent dynamic parameters
could be changed using
$codei%
	%f%.dynamic_parameter(%dynamic_par_vec%)
%$$
$lnext
A function would be added to detect a dynamic parameter; i.e.,
$codei%
	Dynamic(%x%)
%$$
where $icode x$$ has type $codei%AD<%Base>%$$ and the result is a $code bool$$.
The detection could be similar to variables; i.e.,
right tape id and dynamic id is not zero.
$lnext
The independent dynamic parameters could correspond to the initial parameters
in the tape (possibly excluding the parameter with index zero).
When the independent dynamic parameters change, a special forward pass
on the dynamic parameter operations would set the value for all
the other dynamic parameters in the tape.
$lnext
The identical functions need to be changed so that dynamic
parameters were never be identically equal other values.
$lend


$head Multi-Threading$$
The TMB packages has a special version of the
$cref checkpoint$$ class
that enables one checkpoint function to be my multiple OpenMp threads.
Perhaps it would be useful to extend the CppAD multi-threading environment
to allow for this.
In addition, perhaps a multi-threading version of an ADFun object would
be useful.

$comment ------------------------------------------------------------------- $$
$head Atomic$$

$subhead Subgraph$$
The $cref subgraph_sparsity$$ calculation treats
each atomic function call as if
all of its outputs depend on all of its inputs;
see $cref/atomic function/subgraph_sparsity/Atomic Function/$$.
These sparsity patterns could be made more efficient
(could have fewer possibly non-zeros entries)
by using the sparsity patterns for the atomic functions.

$subhead New API$$
A new API for atomic functions could be created that uses
$cref sparse_rc$$ for sparsity patterns and an interface like
$codei%
	%afun%.jac_sparsity(%select_domain%, %select_range%, %pattern_out%)
	%afun%.hes_sparsity(%select_domain%, %select_range%, %pattern_out%)
%$$
see $cref subgraph_sparsity$$.
This would be simpler for the user.

$subhead Sparsity$$
Add an $cref atomic_option$$ that checks if the sparsity patterns calculated
by user atomic functions have
elements for arguments that are know to be parameters and
could be more efficient.
For example, the user's version of $code for_sparse_jac$$ could check
$cref/x/atomic_for_sparse_jac/Implementation/x/$$ to see for which components
are variables;
i.e., $cref/isnan(x[j])/nan/isnan/$$ is true for a particular call.
Note that
$cref/vx/atomic_for_sparse_hes/Implementation/vx/$$ should be removed,
because the method above can be used to determine this information.

$subhead Element-wise Operations$$
Add user atomic functions for element-wise addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.
Where the operands are $cref/simple vectors/SimpleVector/$$
with elements of type $codei%AD<%Base%>%$$.

$comment ------------------------------------------------------------------- $$

$head check_finite$$
$list number$$
Sometimes one only gets infinite value during zero order forward
and nan when computing corresponding derivatives.
Change $cref check_for_nan$$ to $code check_finite$$
(not infinite or nan) so that error detection happens during zero
order forward instead of later.
$lnext
In addition, the current $cref check_for_nan$$ writes the corresponding
zero order values to a temporary file.
It would be nice if the $code check_finite$$ routine made writing
the zero order values optional.
$lend

$head test_boolofvoid$$
For general purpose use, the $cref test_boolofvoid$$ should be usable
without including a memory check at the end.

$head Eigen$$
Use a wrapper class for
$cref/eigen vectors/testvector/Eigen Vectors/$$ so that the
$code size$$ member function returns a
$code size_t$$ instead of an $code int$$.
This would allow $cref TESTVECTOR$$ to be a true template class; i.e.,
to use the syntax
$codei%
	TESTVECTOR<%Scalar%>
%$$

$head Example$$
Split the $cref/example list/ListAllExamples/$$
into separate groups by the corresponding example subdirectory.

$comment ----------------------------------------------------------------- $$
$head Optimization$$

$subhead Taping$$
Perhaps some of the optimization done while taping forward mode
should be delayed to the $code optimization$$ step.

$subhead Special Operators$$
Add special operators that can be implemented more efficiently, e.g.,
$codei%
	square(%x%) = %x% * %x%
%$$
and have the optimizer recognize when they should be used.
(They could also be in the user API, but it would not be expected
that the user would use them.)

$subhead Memory$$
The $cref optimize$$ command seems to use a lot of memory when the
tape is large. We should create a test case that demonstrates this and then
work on reducing the amount of memory needed by this operation.

$comment ------------------------------------------------------------------ $$
$head checkpoint$$

$subhead Retape$$
Perhaps there should be a version of the
$cref checkpoint$$ class that uses a tapeless AD package to compute
the derivative values.
This would allow for algorithms where the operations sequence
depends on the independent variable values.
There is a question as to how sparsity patterns would be determined
in this case.
Perhaps they would be passed into the constructor.
If it was known to be constant,
the user could compute the pattern using CppAD.
Otherwise, the user could input
a conservative estimate of the pattern that would be correct.

$subhead Testing$$
There should be some examples and tests for both speed and memory use
that demonstrate that checkpointing is useful.

$comment -------------------------------------------------------------------$$

$head Compilation Speed$$
Create a library corresponding to $code AD<double>$$ so that
one does not need to re-compile all the header files every time.

$head Base Requirements$$
Change the $cref/Base requirements/base_require/$$ to use template
specialization instead of functions so that there is a default value
for each function. The default would result in a
$cref/known/cppad_assert/Known/$$ assert when the operation is used and not
defined by the base class.
An example of this type of template specialization can be found in
the implementation of $cref to_string$$.

$head Adolc$$
Create a documentation page that shows how to convert Adolc commands to
CppAD commands.

$head Forward Mode Recomputation$$
If the results of $cref forward_order$$ have already been computed and are still
stored in the $cref ADFun$$ object (see $cref size_order$$),
then they do not need to be recomputed and the results can just be returned.

$head Iterator Interface$$
All of the CppAD simple vector interfaces should also have an
iterator version for the following reasons:
$list number$$
It would not be necessary to copy information to simple vectors
when it was originally stored in a different type of container.
$lnext
It would not be necessary to reallocate memory for a result that is
repeatedly calculated
(because an iterator for the result container would be passed in).
$lend

$head Operation Sequence$$
It is possible to detect if the
AD of $icode Base$$
$cref/operation sequence/glossary/Operation/Sequence/$$
does not depend on any of the
$cref/independent variable/glossary/Tape/Independent Variable/$$ values.
This could be returned as an extra
$cref seq_property$$.

$head Software Guidelines$$
The following is a list of some software guidelines taken from
$href%http://www.boost.org/development/requirements.html#Guidelines%boost%$$.
These guidelines are not followed by the current CppAD source code,
but perhaps they should be:

$list number$$
Names (except as noted below)
should be all lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
For example, acronyms should be treated as ordinary names
(xml_parser instead of XML_parser).

$lnext
Template parameter names should begin with an uppercase letter.

$lnext
Use spaces rather than tabs.
Currently, CppAD uses a tabs stops at column multiples of 5.
Five columns were chosen to avoid high levels of indenting and to allow for
$codep
	if( expression )
		statement
	else	statement
$$
with a tab after the else.
Automatic conversion to actual spaces should be easy.

$lend

$head Tracing$$
Add tracing the operation sequence to the user API and documentation.
Tracing the operation sequence is currently done by changing the CppAD
source code. Use the command
$codep
	grep '^# *define *CPPAD_.*_TRACE' cppad/local/*.hpp
$$
to find all the possible tracing flags.


$head atan2$$
The $cref/atan2/Atan2/$$ function could be made faster by adding
a special operator for it.

$head BenderQuad$$
See the $cref/problem/BenderQuad/Problem/$$ with the
current $code BenderQuad$$ specifications.
